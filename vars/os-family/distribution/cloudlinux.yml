# NOTE: CloudLinux can work fine with EPEL, but oficially they recommend
#       "protect" the cloudlinux-base repository. Since I do not have test
#       servers (just production servers) I will temporary just overryde
#       default RedHat variable to empty array instead of automate this
#       configuration. (fititnt, 2019-12-08 07:46 BRT)
