"`a2s`" is a non-official `Syntactic Sugar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar>`_
for `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_, which without extensions already is
an *"Simple, agentless IT automation that anyone can use"*.

If you are new to Ansible, we recommend read our :ref:`installation-guide`. But
"`a2s`" is installable as an Ansible Role and is distributed over Ansible Galaxy:

.. code-block:: bash

  ansible-galaxy install fititnt.syntactic_sugar
