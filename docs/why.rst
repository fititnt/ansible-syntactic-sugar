.. note::

  This pages assumes that you or already work or want to learn how to automate
  IT and already have some experience on how to do without automation. A great
  example if you are someone who would be able to follow tutorials like
  `How To Install WordPress with LAMP on Ubuntu 18.04 <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-lamp-on-ubuntu-18-04>`_
  but now want to abstract this with reusable rules.

  If you already use software that someone else configure the operational
  system for you, it's very likely that at this moment `a2s` may not be useful.

a2s is dedicated to public domain
==================================

In short: while atribution is welcome from ansible users (most because it may
help to find documentation) you as open source contributor is free to take take
parts of a2s source code without mention.
